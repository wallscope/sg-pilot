  <h1>About the Pilot</h1>

  <p>The aim of the Pilot is to demonstrate how a Graph Database can work to surface relationships and information. This type of database is well suited to ingesting any number of live data streams, to provide essential information on documents, document stores and the connections between them. </p>

  <p>The tool that has been built is a Graphical User Interface which supports the exploration and discovery of a range of relationships across Scottish Government documents. Its intention is to improve collaboration at a human and information level. For the purposes of this Pilot a limited set of documents were used.</p>

  <p>The tool provides increased visibility across multiple information sources and can potentially link common denominators such as business goals, project goals, organisations and an array of subjects common to each source. In short, a cross departmental, organisational or even national view can be achieved by targeting predefined common denominators.
  Essentially it improves the search and discovery of information based on contextual relationships, allows better questions to be asked and improves efficiency. This supports the search and discovery of references which may not be apparent or have been forgotten. </p>
